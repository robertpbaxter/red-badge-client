# Features:

-Designed in Angular 7 and styled with Angular Material + CSS

-Users can list or search for rental / roommate opportunities using housing entries with a corresponding google maps coordinate (maps are employed instead of concrete addresses to allow user-defined levels of privacy)

-Administrators are a special role that can monitor and process tickets as support or report requests via routes accessible only to users with administrator permissions (log in with the email 'admin@admin' and password 'admin' to view the admin components)
