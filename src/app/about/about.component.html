        Robert Baxter is an empirically trained linguist turned developer on a
        journey exploring the linguistics of artificial languages. He thrives on
        the acquisition and implementation of technology, particularly when
        faced with challenges of logic. Upon completion of his training with
        Eleven Fifty Academy, he plans on continuing to acquire new programming
        languages in a career of full stack application development.
